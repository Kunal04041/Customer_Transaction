# Customer Transaction Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer transactions based on a dataset with **200 unknown features**. Using machine learning techniques, the model identifies patterns in customer behavior to make accurate transaction predictions.


## Dataset
The dataset consists of **200 anonymized features** along with a target variable indicating whether a customer made a transaction. Due to the unknown nature of features, feature engineering and selection play a crucial role in model performance.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional for deep learning models)


pip install -r requirements.txt


## Model
This project applies:
- **Feature Engineering**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, PCA, and feature selection.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure performance.


## Features
- **Handles high-dimensional data** with 200 unknown features.
- **Multiple ML models** for comparison.
- **Scalable and optimized for large datasets**.
